  <h1>Full Developmental Package</h1>
  <p>The Developmental Package is a comprehensive three step process designed to guide you from initial ideas to a strong, fully polished essay. 
  It includes a (40) minute conversation to get to know you as a person and applicant, followed by two remote edits&mdash; a developmental edit 
  to refine and encourage the most compelling ideas in your essay, and a polish edit to ensure clarity and flow. </p>

  <h1>Remote Editing:</h1>
  <p>We offer remote reading, editing, and analysis of personal statements, supplemental materials, 
    and scholarship essays. You will receive detailed line edits and feedback throughout
    your essay, with a focus on messaging, clarity, structure, and style. We will also provide a broader review 
    that summarizes our feedback, assesses the overall strength of the essay,
    and outlines clear next steps to guide you through the revision process. Essays are submitted at the link provided
    and returned with edits within five (5) business days.  </p>
