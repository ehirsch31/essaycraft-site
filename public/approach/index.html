The key to our success is our three step approach which in includes a conversation to get to know you as a person and applicant,
a developmental edit to refine and encourage the most compelling ideas in your essay, and a polish edit to ensure everything flows
smoothly. Throughout this process, we always focus on three criticial areas:</p></section><section class=approach-grid><div class=approach-pair><div class=left><p>Narrative</p></div><div class=right><p>The ultimate goal of a college essay is to tell a story that communicates a compelling message about who you are and what you value.
It is your only opportunity to speak to an admissions officer in your own voice, on a topic you can choose. The stakes are high, so you need to be intentional about what you say and how you say it. As your advisors,
our top priority is to ensure your message is powerful, clear, and well-structured, so it leaves a positive
and lasting impression.</p></div></div><div class=approach-pair><div class=left><p>Authenticity</p></div><div class=right><p>The best admissions essays are original, honest, and written in your own voice.
Our goal is never to micromanage your content choices or write your essay for you. Instead, our
feedback clearly guides you towards the most polished and effective version of your work, so you end up with a
strong essay that you are proud to have written.</p></div></div><div class=approach-pair><div class=left><p>Style</p></div><div class=right><p>Most admissions essays will be no more than a single-spaced page in length. With so little space, it's important that
your writing is clear, concise, and purposeful. We will help you refine your language and mechanics to ensure your essay
is clean and engaging from start to finishâ€”and that nothing distracts from the message you're trying to convey. This includes
sharpening sentence structure, eliminating clutter, fixing punctuation and grammar, and ensuring your narrative flows naturally
and easily.</p></div></div><section class=about-bottom-row></section></main><footer><p>&copy; ESSAYCRAFT ADVISING 2025.</p></footer><script>function toggleMenu(){const e=document.getElementById("mobile-menu");e.classList.toggle("show")}</script></body></html>
