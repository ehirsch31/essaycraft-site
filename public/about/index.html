    <h1>Eric</h1>
    <p>A Marine Corps veteran, former collegiate walk-on athlete, once classical musician, and
      current law student, Eric is particularly attuned to how individual experience shapes our
      goals and values. As an essay advisor, he helps students craft narratives that
      effectively convey the significance of formative moments, events, and circumstances in
      a way that captures the attention of admissions committees. Before joining the military
      in 2021, he worked as a college advisor and SAT/ACT tutor for four years.</p>
    <p> He graduated from Yale University with a degree in economics and is pursuing a J.D. at
      the New York University School of Law. In his free time, he enjoys reading, running
      (slower than heâ€™d like), and lifting weights. </p>

    <h1>Ben </h1>
    <p>Ben has made a career out of helping both professional and amateur writers reach their full 
      potential. As a literary agent, he works closely with leading researchers, journalists, and 
      thought leaders to develop their book proposals, edit their manuscripts, and place essays in 
      major newspapers and magazines. As a college essay advisor, he uses those same tools to help 
      students create engaging and authentic narratives that they feel proud to have written. </p>
    <p> He graduated from Yale University with a degree in philosophy, and he lives in London where you 
      can find him reading in parks around the city.</p>
