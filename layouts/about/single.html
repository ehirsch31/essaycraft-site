    <h1>Eric</h1>
    <p>Eric is a Marine Corps veteran, former collegiate walk-on athlete, accomplished amateur classical musician, and
      current law student.  Before joining the military in 2021, he worked as a college advisor and SAT/ACT tutor for four years.
      Eric is particularly attuned to how lived experience shapes identity, ambitions, and values. As an essay advisor, he helps 
      students communicate the significance of their experiences through compelling narratives that capture the attention 
      of admissions committees. </p>
    <p>He graduated from Yale University with a degree in economics and is pursuing a J.D. at
      the New York University School of Law. In his free time, he enjoys reading, running
      (slower than heâ€™d like), and lifting weights. </p>

    <h1>Ben </h1>
    <p>Ben has made a career out of helping both professional and amateur writers reach their full 
      potential. As a literary agent, he works closely with leading researchers, journalists, and 
      thought leaders to develop their book proposals, edit their manuscripts, and place essays in 
      major newspapers and magazines. As a college essay advisor, he uses those same tools to help 
      students create engaging and authentic narratives that they feel proud to have written. </p>
